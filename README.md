time dependent commute maps

well we all use google maps to find best route from a to b or to find a desired location but can we get what is farest and least distance we can travel given location and time ? to do this we need the help of a commute maps these maps give us area that we can cover given location and traveltime . but current commute maps are static in nature they dont show changes in traffic and congestion on their maps so here in this project we are integrating real time traffic and commute maps to give us idea of how much distance we can travel given time at that location at that instance.
